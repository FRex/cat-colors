# Cat Colors
A set of few scripts to color cat output, just printing an ANSI color code,
calling cat with all provided arguments, then printing ANSI reset code.

Generated using `generate-colored-cat-commands.sh` (also in the repo). Just
`cp cat-* somedir` where `somedir` is some directory in the `PATH`, where
you keep extra scripts, or even `/bin` or `/usr/bin` (not advised), or add
this directory to the `PATH`.
